Q3. 
Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans-
Truth table for and operator
A    B  A and B              
0    0    0
0    1    0
1    0    0
1    1    1

Truth table for Oor operator
A    B  A or B              
0    0    0
0    1    1
1    0    1
1    1    1


Truth table for not operator

A     not A
0      1
1      0



Q4. 
What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Ans-4
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)   -----False
not (5 > 4)            -----False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)    -----True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))---False
(True and True) and (True == False)---- False
(not False) or (not True) ---True

Q5.
What are the six comparison operators?

Ans-5
  The six comparison operators are given below, > #greater than

>=  #greater than or equal to
<   #less than
<=  #less than or equal to
==  # equal to
!=  # not equal to

Q6.
How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Ans-6
  when we want to assign a value to a variable then we use assignment operator i.e '=' 
  and when we want to compare a value with others then we'll use equal to operator i.e '=='.
  
  '==' will return a boolean value , that is True/False and '=' will assign a value to a variable.

ex- (4/2) == 2 ----- True (comparison)
     a = 10  ------- Assign 10 to the varible a
     
     
Q7
Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans-7
          spam = 0
          if spam == 10:
          print('eggs')
          -----block2-----
          if spam > 5:
          print('bacon')
          -----block3-----
          else:
          print('ham')
          print('spam')
          print('spam')

Q8. 
Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans-

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print("Greetings!")

Q11. 
In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

  i.e
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9

Q12. 
Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans-
------using for loop------
for i in range(1,11):
       print(i)
----using while loop------    
i= 1
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i+=1
